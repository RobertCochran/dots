# dots

## Introduction

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. Most of it is geared towards a git-, Emacs-, and zsh-centric workflow. You'll also find some legacy files for e.g. bash that haven't been touched in ages.

This repository also contains a useful script called `configctl`, which is used to manage all the files in this repository. It's semi-automatic and is pretty easy to understand (`head -25 configctl` will show a nice overview of the parameters).
